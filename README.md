OrderDropper is a food ordering site which allows restaurants to post, edit, and delete their dishes, and allows buyers to add dishes to their cart and order them.

In order to set up this app locally, create .env files in both the client and backend with the following environment values:

Client:
VITE_API_URL=Where you are hosting your backend (http://localhost:4000)

Backend:
MONGODB_URI=Link to MongoDB Cluster
JWT_SECRET=String to sign JWT tokens with
APP_ORIGIN=Where you are hosting your client (http://localhost:5173)
PORT=Port that the server is listening in on (4000)
